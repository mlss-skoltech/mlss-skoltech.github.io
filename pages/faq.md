### When can I apply?	
The application system will open in March, 2019. See the applications page for more information on the process, and other important dates.
### How should I arrange accommodation?	
See the page describing the local arrangements.
### What is the poster session?	
Posters are a long-standing tradition at the MLSS. Each applicant is asked to bring along a poster presentation covering some of their own work. 
This does not need to be published work (ongoing work, or work resulting from undergraduate projects is also fine, were applicable). 
While the day program covers broad areas of general interest, the poster sessions offer participants a chance to discuss their own work with their peers. 
The poster presentations will be a relaxed affair: Posters will be distributed across a room, with participants presenting to small groups of two or three standing in front of their posters.
### Are there any Travel Grants or Scholarships for attending the Summer School?	
There is a section of the application form which will allow you to state whether you need financial assistance and how much. 
You should use the Supplement box to add additional details about your circumstances. Your letter of reference should also mention that you need financial aid.
### I am not affiliated with any university or company currently. Can I still apply?	
Please write “None” in the affiliation field and provide additional details in the Supplement box. You will still need to provide a letter of reference.
